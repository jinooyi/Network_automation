# Network Automation script demostration

This repository contains small, focused Python examples demonstrating
network automation, inventory parsing, and log analysis.

## Included Examples

### 1. Router Inventory Filtering
- Gather OS version and BGP neighbor count from a router fleet
- Identify routers matching specific conditions

### 2. BGP Remediation Automation
- Identify affected BGP sessions based on software version and attributes
- Apply targeted remediation logic (simulated)

### 3. NSM / Syslog Parsing
- Parse faux NSM data
- Identify and count DENY events by source IP

### The goal is to demonstrate:
- Inventory-driven automation
- Clear filtering logic
- Practical Python for network operations
- Readable, explainable code
